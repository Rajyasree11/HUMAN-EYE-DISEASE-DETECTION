# HUMAN-EYE-DISEASE-DETECTION
This project focuses on detecting retinal diseases such as DME, Drusen, and CNV using deep learning. Early diagnosis is crucial, but manual examination can be slow and limited by the availability of specialists.  The system uses a MobileNetV3-based CNN. Trained on a large dataset, the model accurately identifies key retinal abnormalities.
